The Butlerian Jihad, also known as the Great Revolt, was a monumental crusade against computers, thinking machines, and conscious robots. It began in 201 BG and concluded in 108 BG, marking a pivotal period in history.@
During this time, few dared to oppose the Jihad. However, a select number of families with significant investments in thinking machines resisted their total destruction. The most prominent of these was House Valeris, responsible for the construction of over 45% of the thinking machines in the universe.@
As the Jihad concluded, those who opposed it were relentlessly hunted down and executed. Resistance was fierce but ultimately futile. Yet, rumours persist that members of House Valeris survived, and with them, the thinking machines.@
