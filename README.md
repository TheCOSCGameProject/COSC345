## Introduction

Valeris is a text-based dungeon crawler that offers players a unique experience with dynamic characters, procedurally generated dungeons, and engaging mini-games. The game is built with a modular design, allowing for continuous integration and testing throughout the development process.

## Features

- **Dynamic Characters:** Interact with characters that can aid or hinder your progress.
- **Mini-Games:** Complete time-based challenges to earn rewards or face unique bosses.
- **Procedural Generation:** Each playthrough offers a new dungeon layout, characters, and challenges.

- **Replayability:** With varying paths, characters, and challenges, no two runs are the same.
